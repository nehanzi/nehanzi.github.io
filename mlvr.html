            In text, it's much simpler than I can tend to make it sound. Passion, intentional communication, and a globally, culturally & historically informed perspective are the glaring traits of mine that when met with a team or environment focused on flexibility and rewarding new solutions, a give and take that can often hit a ceiling without resources or room for improvement, can result in such innovation and productivity that foster growth both internally and at large.

            However, these characteristics alone are not what will give my career, as it stands and moving forward, and I merit. I've taken the challenge of entering a new field and setting loftier goals because I recognized that it will be my vision and my consistency that will create the world I would like to live in. The resources and the tools that exist are important because there are teams and individuals who will do the tedious work of learning how to use them to shape any progress necessary. As an educator, as a manager and as just a team member, I've learned that regardless of any particular proclivities, talents or familiarities, this is what is most substantial. I just decided early enough to cultivate them.
