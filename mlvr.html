          <p class="mb-4">
            With a professional career split between leadership & management and ground-level skills acquisition and development, Nehanzi is focused on learning the purpose and intent of a team/organization and being able to coordinate it, communicate it and put it into action. Having applied this in an array of environments, from education to hospitality, he brings with him a honed ability to join or form teams of different sizes, paces, needs and offer propulsion and cohesion. 

            Reflected in the code are a grasp of the needs of a budget, inventory and personnel necessary in hospitality and the guidance, conception, written and verbal communication necessary in education. This integrated with a knowledge of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript and Dev Tools such as Bootstrap, Github and VS Code.
